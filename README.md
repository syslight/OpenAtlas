## plugin start
download aapt from repo,and  you should use build-tool version 22.x.x,
write your plugin as normal app, ant build  with  hacked aapt.
### plugin resource notice
you can define your package id at Manifest by "versionName",such as versionName:"1.0.1" ,but as a plugin should be versionName:"1.0.10x7a",you will get apk which versionName is "1.0.0" but package id is 0x7a not 0x7f.you can use 0x2 to 0x7,
also you can define package change packageName "com.myapp.pkgname" to " com.myapp.pkgname0x7a".
